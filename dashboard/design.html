        <h2>User Centered Design</h2>
        <p>
          Our team believes that the best technology is the kind that truly serves its users. So, as we developed
          the Lysten system, we kept a tight feedback loop with our potential customers. We interviewed
          students, professors, and administrators from the UC Berkeley MIDS program to find out what features were
          most important to them. This market research work heavily influenced the design of Lysten, and we
          pivoted our vision multiple times to best match the needs of our users.
          In the end, we believe we've created a system that will greatly benefit everyone involved in the
          online education environment.
        </p>

        <h3><i>Student Reaction to Lysa</i></h3>
        <p>
          We reached out to 30 online students via survey to understand their current frustrations
          with course feedback systems, and how they would prefer to provide input. </p>

        <p> We learned that the timing
          of course surveys did not actually meet the students' desires; they were asked to provide feedback
          at the mid- and end-points of the term, but never actually got to see their feedback incorporated into the
          class. Low turnout rates for these course feedback surveys made it seem like students did not want
          to provide feedback; in reality, they were just not incentivized to do so, since they never saw the
          fruits of their effort. In reality, students were willing to provide feedback more frequently
          than twice a term, provided that they personally reaped some benefit from it.
          With Lysa, we emphasized the ability to provide feedback at <i>any point</i> during
          the term, so that professors can get real-time feedback and incorporate changes quickly. We hope that
          students are encouraged by this reactivity, and will engage proactively with the Lysa as they see
          their input taken into consideration.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also learned that students often have feedback about a specific aspect of a course, and wish
          to provide comments on just that element. However, current course surveys are not set up for such
          specific focus; you must fill out the entire survey, covering <i>all</i> topics, before you submit.
          With Lysa, we decided to engage at the single-topic level, so that students can comment on
          the most relevant aspects of the course in a given moment. For example, they can provide feedback
          on assignments the week they are given, without having to also comment on the instruction or async
          materials. We hope that, given the ability to provide more pointed commentary, students will
          not feel overwhelmed by long surveys and will be more willing to provide feedback.

        </p>

        <h3><i>Faculty Reaction to Dashboards</i></h3>
        <p>
          We interviewed a diverse group of 10 faculty members (including program directors,
          student success team members, seasoned professors, and even recent students-turned-professors) to
          understand how online educators digest and incorporate the feedback they receive from students.
        </p>

        <p>
          We found that, despite an intimidating volume of text, professors really do want to read every
          comment from every student. While a high-level summary is helpful for context and pattern finding,
          the individual comments are very valuable themselves. With that in mind, we created the
          <a href="student_responses.html">Student Responses dashboard</a>, where professors can see the full
          text of every student comment. We simply added filters to make the information more digestable.
        </p>

        <p>
          We learned that point-in-time ratings and scores are not particularly useful, as they can be
          subjective. In reality, trends over time are far more useful as faculty try to adjust their courses.
          The <a href="topic_stream.html">Topic Stream dashboard</a> provides this over-time view, so that
          faculty can see what topics are discussed more or less frequently over the years, terms, and across
          various courses.
        </p>

        <p>
          Professors want to incorporate student feedback and make course adjustments, however it is difficult
          to do so if the comments are vague or over-dramatic. Many faculty members wished for specific examples
          to be given with course comments, which make feedback more actionable. We reflected this desire in
          Lysa's conversation style, requesting examples of both positive and negative aspects
          of the course.
        </p>

        <h3><i>Beta Testing</i></h3>
        <p>
          We developed the initial Lysten system based on the above market research, then conducted a beta phase
          to get reactions from real users. Students were invited to engage with Lysa directly, and faculty members
          were allowed to play around with the dashboard screens. We made further refinements based on their
          reactions and comments.
        </p>

        A trial version of Lysa is currently deployed in an independent test Slack
        instance. Visit <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/lysten/signup" style="color:#6495ED">this link</a> to sign up!
        You'll need an email address from either @berkeley.edu or @ischool.berkeley.edu.
        <br>
        This trial instance doesn't require users to provide their full name as the username -- feel
        free to sign up with an anonymous handle. Note that while the Lysten system collects
        only the anonymous Slack ID for each user (ex. UFR6C3N5B), your handle will be visible to everyone
        in the Lysten workspace.
