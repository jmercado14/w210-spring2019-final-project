    <h1> <strong> Lysa: a Companion for Students </strong></h1>
    <h4>
      <br>
      At any time throughout the semester, online students can initiate a chat with Lysa, the friendly
      chatbot component of the Lysten system. They can chat about a wide range of topics including
      course materials, technology, registration, and more. Lysa participates actively in the conversation,
      prompting the student for details and examples. This back and forth helps refine comments, making them
      more helpful and constructive.

    <h1><strong> Lysten: Making Data Actionable for Professors and Administrators </strong></h1>
    <h4>
      <br>
      Feedback collected by Lysa is displayed through easy-to-use dashboards, where faculty can view and digest
      a large number of comments quickly and effectively. Machine learning models help extract common topics
      and themes, which are visualized on a Topic Stream dashboard that illuminates trends over time. Faculty
      can also view the full set of comments through the Student Responses dashboard; filters and sorting
      create a format that is easy to handle.
    </h4>

  <div style="width: 100%; display: inline-block;">
    <h1><strong> Easy Integration</strong></h1>
    <h4>
    <br>
    Lysa can integrate directly into an online program's existing Slack environment, making it easy for students to
      reach out and removing a significant effort barrier that often prevents students from providing course
      feedback.
    </h4><h4>
    Faculty members are given personal login credentials to ensure that each professor can view only the data
      relevant to his or her specific class. Administrators and student support can be given permission to view
      all courses and terms, so that they can observe overall trends and patterns across the entire education
      environment.
    </h4><h4>
    The dashboards automatically update periodically, so that new feedback is incorporated into
      the visualizations weekly. With so much happening automatically, faculty members can spend less time
      organizing piles of comments, and more time diving into the data itself.

        A trial version of Lysa is currently deployed in an independent test Slack
        instance. Visit <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/lysten/signup" style="color:#6495ED">this link</a> to sign up!
        You'll need an email address from either @berkeley.edu or @ischool.berkeley.edu.
        <br>
        This trial instance doesn't require users to provide their full name as the username -- feel
        free to sign up with an anonymous handle. Note that while the Lysten system collects
        only the anonymous Slack ID for each user (ex. UFR6C3N5B), your handle will be visible to everyone
        in the Lysten workspace.
