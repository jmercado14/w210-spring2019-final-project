    <h2>Data Processing and Modeling</h2>

    <p>
      Every piece of feedback that comes in from students is processed through a pipeline that cleans,
      categorizes, and pulls keywords out of the feedback text. A subtopic is then assigned to that
      piece of feedback to enable professors and administrators to identify patterns and common subjects
      of conversation via the Lysten dashboard, where these derived subtopics are available for analysis.
    </p>

    <p>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_Dirichlet_allocation">Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA)</a>
      is a type of natural language processing topic model that looks at a
      body of documents and determines what parts of those documents make them similar to each other.
      It is able to turn those similarities into topics and determine which individual words or sets
      of words are associated with each of the topics it’s discovered.
    </p>

    <p>
    We utilized LDA modeling to process several hundred thousand course survey results from
      <a href="https://www.ratemyprofessors.com"> RateMyProfessors.com (RMP)</a>, a
      website where students can leave feedback on courses they’ve
      taken and review feedback left by other students. The dataset was released publicly as part of a
      <a href = "https://www.kaggle.com/c/rate-my-professors/">Kaggle competition</a> held in 2016.
    </p>

    <p>
        In order to make sure that the LDA algorithm is as successful as possible, we looped through every piece
      of feedback in the RMP dataset to clean and prep it for analysis. Among other steps, this included:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>- Converting words to their lemma form (e.g. “studies”, “study”, “studying” would all be converted to “study”)</li>
        <li>- Removing stop words, web links, unexpected characters, and words less than four characters in length</li>
        <li>- Tokenizing each piece of feedback into individual words as well as bigrams (collections of two sequential
      words that may be related, e.g. “office hours”)</li>
        <li>- Filtering to only feedback from subjects rather to data science, e.g. Mathematics and Statistics, to limit
      the number of topics generated that are unrelated to our use case</li>
    </ul>
      
    <p></p>
      
    <p>
    We then used the Python <a href = "https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/ldamodel.html">gensim implementation
      of LdaModel</a>, and generated hundreds of different models with
      varying parameter values to find the model that produced the most coherent, human-readable collection
      of topics as well as the optimal number of final topics. To measure topic coherence, we used the
      <a href="https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/coherencemodel.html">gensim
        CoherenceModel</a> and looked at both the ‘c_v’ and ‘u_mass’ forms to generate numeric coherence scores.
    </p>
      

    <p>
    Finally, once our ideal models were finalized and saved, we applied these models to a combination of data
      from the “class-recs” channel in the ISchool Slack workspace, as well as the collection of feedback
      that MIDS students provided as part of our Lysten/Lysa beta in Slack. These enhanced data are what
      is displayed in the demo Lysten dashboards.

        A trial version of Lysa is currently deployed in an independent test Slack
        instance. Visit <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/lysten/signup" style="color:#6495ED">this link</a> to sign up!
        You'll need an email address from either @berkeley.edu or @ischool.berkeley.edu.
        <br>
        This trial instance doesn't require users to provide their full name as the username -- feel
        free to sign up with an anonymous handle. Note that while the Lysten system collects
        only the anonymous Slack ID for each user (ex. UFR6C3N5B), your handle will be visible to everyone
        in the Lysten workspace.
