        <h2>About Lysten</h2>
        <p>
          Lysten was conceived as a final project for the <a href="https://datascience.berkeley.edu/academics/curriculum/synthetic-capstone-course/">
          w210 capstone course</a> of the <a href="https://datascience.berkeley.edu/">UC Berkeley MIDS program</a>, as a tool to
          enable conversation between students and professors during the course of the semester, trimester, or quarter.
        </p>
        <p>
          The name “Lysten” is a play on “Listen”, which is what we hope to be able to do for both students and professors -
          providing a empathetic ear for students’ feedback, and serving up key insights from that feedback for professors.
          Lys means “light” in Danish, and represents both education (via a lightbulb) and our goal of illuminating specific,
          helpful insights. “Lys” also plays on the “analysis” that the product performs on the students' feedback.
        </p>

        <h3><i>Product Vision</i></h3>
        <p>
        Virtual classrooms pose a unique social problem:
        It is critical to collect constant feedback to ensure the course design and materials are at their best. However,
        students and professors don’t have the same kind of relationship that face-to-face physical classes can foster.
        This lack of personal relationship can make the feedback loop difficult to facilitate.
        </p>

        <p>
        Students are often given only limited options to provide formal feedback (in the form of mid- and end-term surveys).
        Even this small amount of data can be difficult to manage, without a way to automatically pull out patterns from the feedback.
        Many Professors in online programs have roles in industry, and don't have the time to spend on fully manual review.
        </p>

        <p>
          Lysten offers a solution: <br>
          &emsp;<i>a system by which students and professors can have an interactive conversation throughout the semester, even when a
          physical space isn’t available.</i>
        <br>
        <br>
          The Lysa chatbot provides a venue for students to air their concerns anytime throughout the semester in a friendly,
          informal, and interactive environment.
          The Lysten system then uses machine learning and natural language processing to sift through the feedback,
          presenting it to instructors and administrators in a clear, concise, and ultimately actionable format.
        </p>

        <p>
        The result is an enhanced experience for all involved.
        </p>

        <h3><i>Development Tools</i></h3>
        <h4>Slack</h4>
          <p>Lysa is built to address students’ feedback needs by combining Node.js module Botkit,
            Express framework and MongoDB that is integrated with Slack.</p>
        <h4>Natural Language Processing</h4>
          <p>Raw student feedback is processed through a pipeline built on Python 3 to aggregate,
            summarize, and analyze it into actionable results. The NLTK package powers text
            preprocessing and cleaning, the Gensim package powers summarization and LDA modeling,
            and the scikit-learn package powers the topic classifiers. See the
            <a href = "modeling.html">Modeling page</a> for more details.</p>
        <h4>Tableau</h4>
          <p>The professor- and admin-facing dashboards are built using Tableau visualizations.
            A Student License through UC Berkeley allows access to Tableau Desktop and Tableau Public
            to deploy to the web.</p>
        <h4>Glitch</h4>
          <p>The Node.js application is hosted on Glitch platform, which can directly accept web
            requests made by Slack’s Events API and respond to students’ chat messages.</p>
