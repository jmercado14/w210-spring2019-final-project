        <h4>Lysten: Empowering Education</h4>
        <p>Lysten was conceived as a final project for the w210 capstone course of the Berkeley MIDS program. “Lysten” is a play on “Listen”, which is what we hope to be able to do for both students and professors - providing a empathetic ear for students’ feedback, and serving up key insights from that feedback for professors. Lys means “light” in Danish, and represents both education (via a lightbulb) and our goal of illuminating specific, helpful insights. “Lys” also plays on the “analysis” that the product performs on the students' feedback.</p>
        
        <h4>Lysa: A Companion for Students</h4>
        <p>Lysa, our mascot and interactive bot, is a key component of the Lysten product. Lysa is the friendly face that students can reach out to at any point during the semester</p>

        <h4>Intended Audience</h4>
        <p>The intended audience for this product is students and professors.</p>
 
        <h4>Data Sources</h4>
