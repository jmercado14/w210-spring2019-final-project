      "then we just get back a grade, with no additional feedback.\n",

      "He is really knowledgeable and writes very clearly but his speaking style was a barrier for me and, in 266, all the professors answer questions, so you can still benefit from his strengths without having him as your main lecturer.\n",
      "he was not particularly responsive to one of the classes about something, and I know it was escalated to MIDS admin people.\n",
      "He's also super accessible on Slack - rarely does it take more than a half hour to get a response from him, and he encourages his class to actively discuss the material on Slack, too.\n",
      "He explains the material well and he answers questions effectively during office hours.\n",
      "She always had good questions for the class to consider during the discussions.\n",

      "You will find yourself looking for alternate sources of lectures that do a better job of explaining the concepts, and the teacher is completely inaccessible outside of class.\n",
      "very good at making sync time effective and he knows his stuff.\n",
      "He does a decent job fostering discussion and does seem serious about helping people learn; he's not one of these \"side-gig\" instructors in my opinion.\n",
      "He doesn't spend much time talking code, which I'm mostly fine with because I prefer getting a solid conceptual understanding out of my sync sessions and can look into the math and code on my own.\n",
      "I liked that he'd bring additional examples (from his work and elsewhere) to class to complement the official material, too.\n",

      "Mobile experience with those isn't great, and the only time where I've seen it used in live sections was RDADA.\n",
      "The poor experience on mobile is my main concern here - being able to do async on the go is a key strategy for fitting MIDS into my life, and these are often a barrier.\n",
      "the experience of watching lectures on mobile is really.\n",
      "the videos lag, i can never get them to download all the way, and then the quality of the videos when fit to a tiny smartphone screen is not great.\n",
