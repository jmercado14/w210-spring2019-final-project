       "'i have no idea how i’m doing so far. we’ve turned in four assignments so far, but i haven’t received feedback on ANY of them. it’s super frustrating. i might be doing great, but i might be failing. i’d ask for more time from the TAs, or try to bring  on some additional TAs so they can turn around assignments faster the way that they encourage lots of class discussion is really nice async is going pretty well, but not super applicable to the live session discussion abe lincoln is the best professor i’ve ever had tech is bad this is a great bot pretty well, actually! i think i’m finally getting the hang of things. the breakout sessions were very engaging, and i really enjoyed the discussion questions one person dominated the full-class discussion, which was annoying. but overall it was a good class they’re fine. problem sets are really helpful, but we haven’t gotten any feedback on them so far so i’m not sure how well i’m actually doing on these. async was okay. it felt superfluous though. it didn’t really have anything to do with what we talked about in live session i feel like we could use an extra TA - it would really help with the problem set feedback turnaround. other than that, things are going well though class is… not going well. i’m feeling a little lost with this week’s material live session was good! lots of lively discussion, which made class go by really fast, which was nice async was pretty repetitive. it felt like a lot of the material was covered multiple times, and then AGAIN in the live session :sleepy: still haven’t gotten any feedback on assignments so far, which is frustrating. they’re pretty straightforward, though, which is nice.\"\\nwe really need to start getting feedback on assignments we’ve turned in. we’re halfway through the semester and i don’t have any grades yet. not okay.\" class is going well! i feel like i’m understanding the material finally, even though i’m not sure what my grade is yet because we haven’t gotten any grades backyet it was good - it ran half an hour over, which was tough, but the discussion was fun so it didn’t seem like it took as long as it did async felt a little long this week, it didn’t seem super relevant to what we talked about in live session the problem sets have been really difficult. i’ve learned a lot, but they take FOREVER and if i wasn’t working with some other students, i’d be totally lost live sessions have been running late recently, which has been really tough on my schedule (i’m in a different time zone, so going late means cutting into my sleep). if we could keep class to the scheduled time, that would make things much easier. class is going REALLY well right now. i’m really enjoying the recent material, and i’m starting to get the hang of it. i feel like i’m keeping up with everyone else for the first  time i  thought the discussion was really productive, though it did get kind  of tense at one point. once we got past the first reading, though, i thought things got back to  normal. it was okay. i feel like the async for the last couple of weeks hasn’t had anything to do with what we’ve actually talked about in live session, but it has been interesting at least. i’m struggling to see why i need to be watching it, though, since we never end up actually reviewing or talking through it didn’t have any assignments this week, so all good live session hasn’t really had anything to do with the async lectures. i’m not really sure whether live session or async is more relevant to what we’re supposed to be taking out of this class :disappointed: haven\\'t gotten any feedback on assignments yet. we\\'re halfway through the semester. this is unacceptable live session feels like a waste of time live session runs forever, feels superfluous, doesn\\'t relate at all to the things we review in async async and live session have nothing to do with each other live session ran over time this week. it always runs late. i\\'m on the east coast, so this means i get much less sleep than i should I found the examples from async, the readings, and assignments incredibly useful even with a background in research. They make it harder to watch async on a mobile device (e.g. if I get a fee min to watch videos over lunch break, it\\'s frustrating to hit one of those walls). But even more annoying is that I have yet to see them ever reviewed by a teacher or discussed in class. Somebody designed this busy work when videos were first created, and current teachers don\\'t care about it. Mobile experience with those isn\\'t great, and the only time where I\\'ve seen it used in live sections was RDADA. Even that was minimal. I\\'m not necessarily opposed to the questions, but it really does help when you know you\\'re getting the extra value by doing them The poor experience on mobile is my main concern here - being able to do async on the go is a key strategy for fitting MIDS into my life, and these are often a barrier. I\\'ve found the mobile app to be :put_litter_in_its_place: as well, though my main complaint is that they don\\'t matter. Discussion questions that don\\'t result in discussions have no reason to exist. So far I’ve liked the async exercises and quizzes in W241\\'s async. It’s the only class so far that I’ve thought made effective use of those, though. W209\\'s exercises are all right as well, but yeah, definitely not mobile friendly. 241 has the best async so far, IMO. Good explanations, good interactivity, and they integrate the textbook very well. It\\'s like the anti 203. I really appreciated 209\\'s Codepen exercises, and so far I think 241\\'s integrated R Studio work is quite good, but the random quizzes or short response questions that predominate in async are terrible. I’d say the best features are the async videos (excellent quality - large video, clear, well spoken - just very good so far).  Downsides I would say the instructors are not as active on Slack (like W261 was awesome about that) so alot of questions are going unanswered (though other people usually work it out).  Its the first class going through assignments, so there have been bugs and unclear points to work out.  This class could really use a TA, but no former students yet! The instructors are definitely good in their professional areas, but they appeared to stumble when I questioned them about something fundamental to CNN. I got the feeling that they are well aware of applying CNN, but not so much about how it works. To top it, there is only one instructor who is semi-responsive on Slack. So, students are trying to figure out the issues on their own through the week. Also, the instructors and TA\\'s are super responsive. Lots of infrastructure issues just in the first 4 weeks, and it  is continuing even now. So, more than solving the actual homework problem, I am spending time trying to figure out logistical issues. Right now it’s pretty light on workload, to the point where I assume we’ll all just get an A, as there hasn’t been very much / anything we’ve done that could be graded. it\\'s definitely a lot of reading + prep on your own. it\\'s a bit of a shame that the time series portion of it wasn\\'t extended much longer (in my opinion) Lots of reading but realistically you can do a lot of skimming. requires almost no work if you\\'ve ever used Linux command line (much less time than the time spent reading in 201). you can get by in 205 without reading anything, but if you do read you might actually learn something (e.g. the chapters on git are actually really good if you want to understand how it works) Going over homework answers in w203 live session *sort of* helps, but sometimes that is unclear. And even when the technical work is clear, that doesn\\'t provide confirmation of specific formatting/expressions, nor on any explanations/rationales I\\'ve written in my assignments. Are people frustrated with the amount of assignments they\\'ve had graded? I certainly am and get a feeling the instructors might be overloaded with work. also has the grading coming in a bit late... Many of us received feedback on our week2 presentations the night before week 6 presentations were due. Similarly, Big Idea #1 hasn\\'t been graded yet, and Big Idea #2 is due very soon. Certainly makes it hard to learn from your own work! Also, the idea that I can only guess how each course is going is a bit uncomfortable. =P Would be nice to have an idea of my running grade, before it is too late to influence it! without hw feedback, I’m left to learn by comparing answers with the solutions worksheet (if provided) I think this is particularly frustrating for us in our first semester - there should be extra emphasis on timely grading, as many of us are adjusting to being back in school after a while and it would be helpful to get more feedback in real time  The more fundamental question might be general workload on the instructors - given that they teach a number of sections and have regular full time jobs, in many cases…. might be an interesting question to look at that “balance” a bit more broadly, and how that translates in to student experience, holistically e.g., where might it cause some other “bumps” as well (e.g., email responsiveness etc). I would like to receive graded HW sooner because I do take corrective action when I miss the mark. Plus I want to make sure I meet GPA requirement for the MIDS degree. I think my main comment is that so many of the major assignments are group that they we only get individual feedback on small homework pieces. Those really don\\'t have a tonne of opportunities to show creatitivity, or much depth. One suggestion is to make more ischool speaker events web-accessible (at least have a recording of it) so MIDS students can benefit from some great topics and speakers The week off for fall immersion seemed unexpected to both of my professors when it came to planning class material/projects/assignments. We were still expected to do assignments, readings, and async material. Can we try to have an actual week off if we are going to do something like this?  I actually need my grades to receive a reimbursement from my company (and I\\'m sure others are in that boat). It was certainly strange to have zero context behind my grade for 201. Even though I\\'m pleased with the outcome, I can only point to a *single* email regarding one assignment for my grade. I think that\\'s concerning.  the organization of class material for both seems quite sloppy. I know that w205 was recently redone, and the prof is very understanding and apologetic that things aren\\'t set up fully. However, they need to make sure those technologies are set-up properly and in sync with one another (one syllabus says this, the other says this). I think its unacceptable to have so many different “sources of the truth”, and frankly I’d prefer we leverage the heck out of one or at most two platforms - until they have figured out how to transition to whatever the new/new is.   And would be great to build in specific training for new technology/software. Could be a series of mini instructional videos … or they could say this specific website / this specific online resource.  Found the answer has been “Google It” a bit too much. I just had assignments graded for 205 and 241. Both were within about 2 weeks of submission, and both had really helpful, thorough feedback/comments for each question. For all the grading issues we had last term, I wanted to mention this as a positive! Feedback on final projects: the administration is well aware of the lack of instructor feedback throughout the semester and especially at final project time. There is discussion around making two end of semester deadlines for instructors, one for final grades, the other for final project feedback. Ideas for how to improve instructor feedback throughout the semester are still being evaluated, more to come when we hear more. The audio quality is pretty bad for some of the async stuff. It’s usually the “guest speakers” that are the issue. I’m watching section 1.4 in W251 and its hard to focus on the speaker with the garbled mess of background noise. Just about any YouTube vlogger has better audio quality than most of these interviews, and that stuff’s free '"
