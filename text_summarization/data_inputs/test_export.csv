ObjectId("5c7ac4f0feb10c04c8758041"),UFR6C3N5B,live session,W271,Jeffrey,12,1,The live sessions are basically a waste of time because jeff gets very defensive when we ask questions about the quiz and this basically turns into a 40 min one way conversation of jeff talking about how he basically copied it straight out of the book, it’s not his fault, etc. etc. I’m asking because I would just like to understand what he was specifically asking for but apparently it’s not possible to have a conversation with my instructor. this is quite disappointing.
ObjectId("5c7ac573feb10c04c8758042"),UFR6C3N5B,assignment,W271,Jeffrey,12,0,We have turned in 4 lab assignments but still have yet to get feedback, let alone grade, on any of them! this is insane! the instructor will say that the grading is up to the TAs, but the TAs say that they can’t do anything until jeff gives them the answer key. I am so worried about my grade. what if i dont pass? what am i supposed to do then? I want the TAs and the instructor to communicate better. we can’t wait forever, this is unacceptable
